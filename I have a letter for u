        <p>Dags, I have something important to tell you...</p>
        <p>Matagal na kitang gusto. I've been keeping this to myself for a while now, but I think it's time you knew. You're someone who has been on my mind a lot lately, and I can't stop thinking about you.</p>
        <p>The truth is, Iâ€™m in love with you. I just wanted to be honest about how I feel, no matter what happens next.</p>
